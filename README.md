## Next Scripts
- Directory enumeration
- Subdomain enumeration
- Use DNS requests to enumerate potential subdomains
- Build the keylogger to send the captured keystrokes to a server built using Python
- Grab the banner of services running on open ports
- Crawl the target website to download .js library files included
- Try to build a Windows executable for each and see if they work as stand-alone applications on a Windows target
- Implement threading in enumeration and brute-forcing scripts to make them run faster
